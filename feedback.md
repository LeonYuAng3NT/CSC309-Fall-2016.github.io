## Overview

To send a message to me (Karen), use the form below. Comments and feedback of all kinds are welcome! You do not need to enter your name or email address *unless you wish to receive a direct response*. Note that your comment or a paraphrase of it may be posted on the discussion board, in lecture, or in some other public forum.

Please do not use this form to ask personal questions (about accounts, marks, assignments etc.), where the instructor needs to know who you are in order to answer your question. Instead, send regular email or visit office hours.

Please do not use this form to ask ordinary questions (about assignments, lecture or course policies) when you don't particularly need to be anonymous. Instead, post these questions on the discussion board where the most relevant instructor will answer them.

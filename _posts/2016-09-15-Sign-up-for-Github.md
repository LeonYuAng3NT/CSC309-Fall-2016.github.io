In CSC309, we will use [GitHub](https://github.com) to distribute individual coding assignments, share course information such as code examples, and host the course code of your team project.

Before we can get started, you need to do a few things:

1. [Sign up for a GitHub account,](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) if you don't already have one.

2. Complete this [registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/5yFRKny3oIIJtsC62) by **Sunday, Sept 18 at 9 pm**

   Please double check the information you enter, before submitting this form, and make sure that: 1) There are no typos, 2) There are no extra spaces, 3) The capitalization (i.e. upper/lower case) is correct.

3. On Saturday night and Sunday night, I will add the students who have already filled in the form to the GitHub organization.  At this point you will get an email inviting you to join the Github organization. **You need to accept the invite** before the process is complete.  You will not be able to submit the first lab until you have completed this process.

If you are on the waitlist, fill in the form anyway.  You can do the first lab.

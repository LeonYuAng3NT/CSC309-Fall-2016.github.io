I am participating in a research study to help us understand how instructors use direct and indirect feedback to ensure their classes are going well. The study is conducted by Velian Pandeliev, a graduate student in our department.  You can read more about it from the link below.

Velian has asked me to post this [Notice of Research](/lectures/309NoticeofResearch.pdf) on the courseweb site. I will also be distributing paper copies of this in class and talking briefly about the study.

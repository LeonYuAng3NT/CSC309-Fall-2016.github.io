Many of you will know that the University has asked us to avoid using Piazza due to privacy concerns.  In particular, Piazza does not guarantee that they won't sell your email address and potentially other personal information.

From their privacy policy:

<blockquote> As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
</blockquote>

However, a good alternative does not seem to be available at this time, so I have created a Piazza instance for CSC309.  It is possible to read the posts on Piazza without logging in, but if you have concerns about using Piazza, please come see me.
